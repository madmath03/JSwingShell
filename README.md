JSwingShell, a Java Swing based shell framework for scriptable actions.

# Summary
JSwingShell, or JSS, was originally developped as an alternative to (often heavy) third party tools for automated tests of a heavy GUI application.
JSS provides a set of tools to create actions that can be executed both by a GUI and by an *internal* shell.
In other words, this is a framework to make a Java Swing application scriptable, allowing your application to create and execute scripts of all your actions.
