# JSwingShell
JSwingShell, a Java Swing based shell framework.

JSwingShell, or JSS, was originally developped as an alternative to (often heavy) third party tools for automated tests of a heavy GUI application.
JSS provides a set of tools to create actions that can be both executed by a GUI and by an internal shell.
